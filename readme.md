# Jordan Tests With marketstack

This package has some sample code using [marketstack](https://marketstack.com/). Marketstack is an API that is extremely easy to use for accessing global real time and historical stock market data.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run `npm i`. 

You'll need to get an API key (from [marketstack](https://marketstack.com/)) and rename `.sample.env` file to `.env` and place your api key there.

There are commented out portions of the code that test with marketstack using axios. Just comment the portions you wish to use in before running.

After that, you just need to run `npm start`.
